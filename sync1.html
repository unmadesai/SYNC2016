SYNC'D METER<br>

<p><b>THE SYNC’D METER AIMS TO IMPROVE THE EXISTING WAY OF CALLIBARATION OF METER. IT REDUCES THE EFFORTS AS WELL AS THE COST INVOLVED IN THE CALLIBRATION METER. BY CENTRALIZING ALL THE METERS WE CAN ADD MORE FEATURES LIKE TRACKING, WOMEN SAFETY ETC.</b></p>
<p>Transport is considered as among the basic requirements in a city like Mumbai. Yet there are loop holes and problems in the present transport systems, which needs to be tackled! When speaking about transport problems the most common one is rickshaw/taxi meter recalibration. A lot of effort, time and money is involved in this task the inconvenience caused to the customers is another major issue.</p>
<p><b>THE IDEA:</b><br>
In a need of the solution we thought what if all the meters of Mumbai are centralized. Here what do we mean by centralized? What if all meters are connected to the RTO wirelessly… What if all the meters are accessed by the RTO wirelessly… This would not only solve the existing problem but also add many new features which will help the citizens in their travelling.</p>
<p>
<b>THE SOLUTION:</b><br>
We explain our solution to this problem through an example; suppose our mobile‘s network company charges us 1 paisa/sec for a call but as the plan is over, the company automatically changes the call rate. EXACTLY what we wish to do, all meters connected to RTO. Each meter will have an unique id which is monitored and accessed by the RTO. As the fare rate changes the RTO automatically changes price of all meter. This thus reduces the cost, time and efforts involved in calibration of meters. Since they are centralized they can be tracked and tampering related issues can also be monitored.  </p>

<b>BLIND ASSISTANT GLOVE</b><br>

<p>The Blind Assistant Glove is aimed to help the visually challenged. It helps them choose their path so that obstacles can be avoided. The glove is a simple wear on and is powered by Replaceable ones.</p><br>

<p>This glove indicates how close or far an obstacle is from the visually impaired. We have also worked on reducing the noise factor, flicker factor which reduces the jitter and also calculates the distance of every new object. This project on its own is effective for future generations. </p><br>

<p><b>How did we make it?</b>
The distance is measured using sensors and the feedback is given by servo motors when the object is in the range of the sensor i.e. 1cm to 200cm. 
</p><br>

<p><b>What are the advantages?</b>
•	It is cost effective
•	It’s compact and efficient.
•	It’ll help visually impaired people to become more independent.

<b>MOBILE CONTROLLED BOT</b>
<p>THE Project aims at controlling the Robot with a Mobile Application.It is conrolled via Bluetooth Module that gets connected to the Arduino. The motor Driver connected in it is used to power the motors as the voltage recieved by motors via the Arduino is too less to move the motors in the specific direction. Once it is connected through the Android Application developed specifically for it, the Arduino receives signals from the bluetooth module and accordingly it moves either straight,backward, left or right depending on the signal received. Currently its a level 5 robot, it can be specifically modified to make it a spy camera robot by adding a camera and coding the Arduino Accordingly. </p>

<b>3-D SCANNER</b>
<p>A 3D scanner is a device that analyses a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g. color).</p>
<p>             In this complex world of explicitly admiring objects, explaining an object can get tough, although we have a conventional drawing system of views, where we have orthogonal, sectional and side views but that could become tricky too. Visualizing intricate objects or a certain part of it can become difficult for professionals like architects, designers too here we have the solution for it...
THE 3D SCANNER
In today’s daily lifestyle we have 3d movies but 3d images are rarely seen. If we do then it’s build on an expensive equipment like industrial computed tomography scanning etc. That’s the reason SYNC CSI-TSEC has now come up with a cost efficient 3d based project. "The 3d image scanner". The purpose of this project is to reduce cost and human efforts.
</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPTION :-</b><br> The center table  is the path of object rotation, the Arduino is connected to the motor as well as to the servo on the camera. For perfect clicking the center table rotates by 15 degrees on the 180 degree angle and clicks approximately 24 pics on 180 and 60 degree angle. The clicked pics are then stored on the base software called as Autodesk 3d.In which the pics get stitched and after an approximate time interval of 30 minutes we get a 3d stitched image of the object kept on the center table.</p>
<p><b>UTILITY AND ADVANTAGES:</b><br>-It is used for viewing 3d objects and other objects in the field of architecture, engineering,  designing , production of movies and video games, industrial design, orthotics and prosthetics, reverse engineering and prototyping, quality control/inspection and documentation of cultural artifacts. It is used to capture the 3D shape of a patient in orthotics and dentistry. It gradually supplants tedious plaster cast. CAD/CAM software are then used to design and manufacture the orthosis, prosthesis or dental implants.</p>
<p><b>HOW IS IT EFFECTIVE?</b><br>
   The project on its own is effective for future generation based upon its cost and importance.
WHAT ABOUT ITS CURRENT VALUE?
   Although the complete project is on its prototype level and is definately  promising. We are demonstrating a concept which can be polished further. With further development and intelligence it can be brought to its peak utilization thus minimizing human efforts and cost.

<b>HOVERCRAFT</b><br>
<p>Hovercraft is the vehicle of future. Hovercrafts do exist, but are not affordable by the common man.Ours is a zero budget hovercraft that is designed to work on batteries.</p>
<p><b>How did we make it?</b><br>
The base of our hovercraft is made of thermocol and the upper part is flexboard reinforced on a thermocol to make it more durable.
Using two motors of 25,000 rpm each, one for filling up our airbag, that is made of polyethylene and the other one is used to direct the hovercrafft. Usually brushless motors are used for hovercrafts that cost around Rs. 25,000 in total. Remote Control of an old, worn out toy car has been used to give direction to our hovercraft.
</p>
<p><b>Why this Hovercraft? What are the advantages?</b><br>
•	It is cost effective
•	It’s compact and efficient.
•	It is the only vehicle which can fly over thin ice and rapid water
•	It  adapts to the environment 
It does not cause any impact on the surface it is being used on.

<b>SHOE CHARGER</b><br>
<p><b>Why did we make it?</b><br>
Due to rapid increase in the demand of energy, new sources of energy needs to be discovered. By using piezoelectric discs we can utilize that energy in the form of electricity by storing that in a capacitor or power bank .Thus, lots of energy can be generated easily by walking. Shoe charger is aimed to help all the human beings who have battery drainage problems of their devices.
</p>
<p>
<b>Concept behind the project</b><br>
Peizoelectricity is the electric charge that accumulates in certain solid materials such as crystals,certain ceramics in response to applied mechanical stress .
</p>
<p><b>ADVANTAGES</b><br>
Electricity can be generated in a cheap way.
No external power sources used to get an output.
It’s also eco-friendly. 
</p>
<p><b>Practical Use</b><br>
As funny as it sounds, charging a phone with your shoe isn’t really joke. Who knows maybe someday shoe companies like Nike could use this insole generators to power the fitness chips that would sync with your phone.
